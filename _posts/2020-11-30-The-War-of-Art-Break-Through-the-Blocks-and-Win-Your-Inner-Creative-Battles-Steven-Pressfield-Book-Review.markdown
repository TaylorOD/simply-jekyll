## What I liked the most:

Framing the creation of art and the natural resistance to the blank canvas or empty page as a force to be battled and overcome is a nice frame change. Hitler found it easier to cause WW2 than to stare at a blank canvas is a line I wont soon forget.

## What I liked the least:

I donâ€™t love the idea of a muse as a spiritual force or being. Year ago I read of creativity or genius as a force that comes and goes and touches people at one time or another. I like that better.
