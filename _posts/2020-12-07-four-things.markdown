## Four Things

There are three things in life I've been good at. Wrestling. Comedy. Recruiting. These all took over my life and were my identity at one point. They all consumed me for several years. I was above average at these things. I was good enough to wrestle in college and earn a scholarship. I was paid as a comedian and performed in front of large crowds and on prestigious stages. I ran my own recruiting office and a profitable business.

My success in these fields can largely be attributed to three things. 

## First: Luck
I started wrestling because my high school coach saw my walk about of the locker room after getting cut from the basketball team and asked if I wanted to fill in on an open spot on the varsity team for someone who was injured. 
I got into comedy because I saw a magazine cover story about Mark Maron and constant listening to his podcast convinced me to try it.
I had accepted a job to work at Chipotle before a recruiter found my resume on Reddit and asked me to interview for an entry level technical recruiter role.

Without the sheer luck involved in all of these events I would have never even gotten started.

## Second: People. 
In each of these situations a person was critical in my success. 
My high school and later college coaches who believed in me and gave me a chance.
The promoters and other comedians who would let me do time on their shows.
The recruiting managers who invested in teaching me and training me.

I was surrounded by people who supported me and helped me learn critical information that I needed to succeeded. 

## Third: Hard Work. 
I was never a naturally athletic wrestler and I certainly wasn't the most talented. I was only good enough to be on my college team because a lot of hours in the gym and a head forward hard nosed wrestling style that wasn't easy and had has long lasting negative effects.
I didn't sleep much when I was doing comedy and my grades suffered greatly but I did comedy 5 nights a week and produced a one man show before I graduated college. 
I lost all my hair and most of my Friday nights building a recruiting career. 

I'm much better now at balancing putting in enough effort and making sure I don't burn out but it's impossible to undervalue what throwing a massive amount of hours at something will do.

## Coding.
I mention all of this because as I have shifted into software development over the last year I reflected back on thing in my past that have helped me grow in the past.
Since making the move into software development I have had a lot of help. I see the same trends.

I had an incredible stroke of luck of working with Jay and Peter at Actualize Coding Bootcamp in the past who were critical in my early software development growth.
I was able to lean on A large network of Chicago engineers and leaders who supported me and gave incredible advice.
And I spent a lot of hours in front of a computer figuring things outs.

Coding is the fourth thing in my life that I want to be good at.
