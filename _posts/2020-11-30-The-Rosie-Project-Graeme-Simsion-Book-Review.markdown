## What I liked the most:

This book made me laugh out loud. I think it is difficult to write comedy well and very difficult to actually make people laugh audible. Even more so when you are presenting in a relatively brief format. 

## What I liked the least:

Teeters on the edge of being appreciated. It just feels weird to laugh at some of the situations that are displayed in a humorous way in the book but that would not be very funny if you were seeing them experienced live.
