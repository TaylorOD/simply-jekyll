## Being Thankful

It's Thanksgiving on one of the strangest and most difficult years of my life. Growing up my family often drove from Vermont to South Carolina to be with my Mom's side of the family. They by far were the best cooks of our extended family. 

Before sitting down to eat way too much turkey, crockpot mac and cheese, and sweet potato casserole we would all gather and list things we were thankful for that year. Everyone in the family went no matter how young or old. This tradition continued into my college years which was made possible because my sister, brother, and I all went to school close enough to South Carolina to travel for the holiday. The 20+ family members took a while to get through and there were often tears but it remains a cherished tradition and memory.

This year I've made a career transition to software development and stepped away from what has been an incredibly steady and monetarily rewarding career in Technical Recruiting. My first few months coding again was scary and I had doubts which were increased by the added stress of the 2020 election and pandemic. 

Things have gotten a bit easier to deal with over the last month or so and I was reminded of our family tradition growing up. I have a few things I'm Thankful for in 2020 that I want to mention. 

1. Friends. 
I am exceptionally bad at keeping in touch with people. Even people I care about deeply. In the past most of the time I spent with friends I was invited by them to do some activity together. This year that has been difficult so keeping in touch has been harder than ever. (I even created ReachOutt.com to help with that problem). 

I'm thankful for friends who have made the effort to schedule Jackbox game nights and a weekly Poker night (let me know if you want to play), for friends who text every week even if sometimes there isn't much to say, and friends who have been supportive and given me words of encouragement in this career transition.

2. Books.
I've always been a big reader but this year my book count has dramatically increased. Getting rid of a commute made my daily morning reading time increase and allowed me to get an extra few pages a day in. I also have found a number of great audiobooks and more time to listen to them around the house. 

Books give me a feeling of stableness during difficult times. This year I really enjoyed The Rosie Project and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. Both were funny and the laughs were very welcomed.

3. Family. 
If I'm bad at keeping in touch with friends I'm somehow even worse at keeping in touch with family. For a few years, I had a great habit of calling my parents weekly on my walk home from Therapy but when that 30-minute walk became a small turn in my desk chair the habit faded away. 
My Brother is my best friend, my sister and her family remind me how precious life is, and my parents provide a constant model of consistent stable life that is reassuring. I love them all. 

I'm thankful for these things this year and countless more things I don't have time to write about. I hope you all have a wonderful Holiday season and are able to think of at least a few things to be thankful for this year.
