## What I liked the most:

The concept of never lying, not even a white lie or a lie of omission, seems like an interesting idea. It would be helpful to many who lie without reason. 

## What I liked the least:

I don't know if never lying is as innovative an idea as Sam Harris believes it to be. While there are merits it also seems like a privileged stance to take. I don't agree with all of the answers he gives to objections raised by his book.
