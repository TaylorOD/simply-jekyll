## What I liked the most:

The characters continue to live and change. You don’t quite get enough Don in the first book so here is a little more.

## What I liked the least:

The plot feels a bit like a just okay improv scene. The writer wrapped everything up in the first book now has to create some drama by nearly causing the collapse of the marriage. Feels a bit… Forced.
