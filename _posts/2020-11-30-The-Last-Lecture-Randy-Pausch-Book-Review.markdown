## What I liked the most:

There are some practical tips here to help people who may be very good at what they do but weak on the social skills aspect that comes with working on a team. It may be helpful for someone from a similar high achieving background to hear this advice from someone like themselves rather than a Tony Robbins who may come off as a Sales guy. 

## What I liked the least:

Most of these tips seem like no brainers to me. However, I recognize that playing sports most of my life and being sent to loads of leadership conferences over the years has cemented much of this stuff in my brain that others might be hearing from this book for the first time.
