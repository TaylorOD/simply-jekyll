## What I liked the most:

I was worried I was going to read a book about a preteen girl and her point of view. I was happy to find that Celeste Ng does an incredible job of moving from character to character during the story. You learn the back story and point of view of many interesting people in the town of Shaker Heights, Ohio.

## What I liked the least:

The ending feltâ€¦ Rushed? I would have liked a bit more closure.
