## What I liked the most:

I love the idea of the moon rebelling. After becoming the new Australian prison no less. Heinlein’s writing is strong and the ideas interesting. 

## What I liked the least:

I think if this book were written today it would be about 100 pages shorter. I don’t know if that is a good or a bad thing. The books didn’t drag per se but the third act felt a little long. 

## Thoughts:
I haven’t read Heinlein before this and I loved his writing. One thing that keeps me coming back to Sci-Fi is that there is so much good content and it rarely feels all that dated. Oddly Cell Phones seem to be the thing that so many Sci-Fi authors from the 60’s and 70’s missed. 

I love the Starship Troopers movie and plan on reading the book soon. Heinlein’s ability to mix humor and great ideas really stand out. Why is a laser beam like a goldfish?
