Here is my github if you are interested: ([[Github::https://github.com/taylorod]]) 
My non blog website is here: (taylorod.github.io)

I am a software engineer that loves the unknown. I like building things and helping create software that connects with users deeply. My experience working with engineers, managers, CTO’s, and CEO’s over the years as a Technical Recruiter has allowed me to see what makes teams work, and often don’t work, well together. 

After years of working in Recruiting, I realized that I wanted to be on the other side of the table. I found myself enjoying the in-depth technical calls I was having more than the sales calls I was used to. Most importantly I wanted a career that challenged me intellectually every day. 

I had previously worked at Actualize Coding Bootcamp as the Director of Career Management and saw how many of our graduates were normal people who, like myself over the last few years, were not satisfied with their current career. I dove into JavaScript and Ruby and haven’t looked back since. 

My degree is in Theater and I wrestled in college. I used to say one day when I was taking off my tap shoes and putting on my wrestling shoes I realized my life was a Disney channel original movie. I love pushing myself and working hard and I am able to bring that passion to my code every day.
