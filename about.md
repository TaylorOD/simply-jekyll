I took my first programming class in high school and copy-pasted my way through making a Worf whack a mole game. Then I got banned from school computers for crashing the shared drive by saving a word doc with my name it in a googol number of times.

I stumbled into Technical Recruiting after college and stepped on a 6-year rocket ship career. When it landed I was running my own tech recruiting office. I realized that I'd accomplished everything that I wanted to do in recruiting and then found myself coding again.

### FAQ

Where were you born?

- South Carolina. But I am not a fan of the south.

Where did you grow up?

- Vermont. I love Vermont and if I could stand living in a small rural area again I'd probably move back.

Why coding?

- I'm chasing the dragon. I want that feeling I had when I made Worf's head pop out of the starship enterprise programming for the first time in high school.
