I took my first programming class in high school, loved it, copy pasted my way through making a Worf whack a mole game and Snake. Then I got banned from computers for the rest of my time in school for crashing the shared drive.

I went to college to wrestle and stumbled into being a theater major. At the tail end of my time in school Improv and Stand Up was about all I cared about. I tell people I got a BA in BS. One day when I was taking off my tap shoes and putting on my wrestling shoes I realized my life was a Disney channel original movie.

I stumbled out of college and into technical recruiting. Turns out performing in front of hundreds of people during college and getting my head beat on for eight years wrestling prepared me well for making cold calls.

After years of working in Recruiting, I realized that I wanted to be on the other side of the table. I found myself enjoying the in-depth technical conversations I was having more than the sales calls. I'd worked as a technical recruiter, recruiting manager, on site client recruiter, recruiting director and opened my own recruiting office. I had done what I wanted in recruiting and I longed a career that challenged me intellectually.

I had previously worked at Actualize Coding Bootcamp as the Director of Career Management and saw how many of our graduates were normal people who, like myself over the last few years, were not satisfied with their current career. I signed up for the next course and dove into JavaScript and Ruby and haven’t looked back since.
